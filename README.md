Liract is a free encryption tool to easily encrypt any Latin text. The software does have the same method for everyone, making it only a fun tool to mess with.
For a real encryption version of Liract, please use [**Enract**](https://github.com/BloodAlibi/EnractVersion).

This software is discontinued and will no longer receive updates. You can still use stable versions, available in Releases.
